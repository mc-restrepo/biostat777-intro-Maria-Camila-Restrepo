Hi there! I'm Camila, a Dentist and Epidemiology master's student at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, originally from Colombia. My work bridges clinical practice and research to improve population-wide oral and child health. By applying epidemiological methods, I aim to address both the underlying causes and direct factors affecting health. My research interests include cleft lip and/or palate, the social determinants of health, preventive oral health, and sleep bruxism in children.
