	abstract = {Objectives The purpose of this study was to examine the association between food insecurity and untreated dental caries using a nationally representative sample of US adults. Methods Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycles 2011-2012 and 2013-2014 on adults aged 18 years and older were analysed (n = 10 723). Primary predictors were overall food security (food-secure/ food-insecure) and household food security (full, marginal, low and very low). The main outcome was any untreated dental caries (none/ ≥ one). Multiple logistic regression analyses were done to estimate the adjusted odds ratio after controlling for confounders. Results Food-insecure adults were more likely to have untreated dental caries than food-secure adults after adjusting for potential confounders (OR: 1.2; 95\% CI: 0.9-1.5). Adults from households with marginal (OR:1.4; 95\% CI:1.5-2.2), low (OR:1.3, 95\% CI:1.3-2.0) and very low food security (OR:1.3; 95\% CI:0.9-1.5) had higher odds of untreated caries than adults from households with full food security. Following age stratification, marginal, low and very low food-secure adults had higher prevalence of untreated dental caries than full food-secure adults across all age groups. Conclusions Our findings suggest that food-insecure adults had higher odds of untreated dental caries than food-secure adults. These findings highlight the importance of assessing food insecurity as a risk factor for dental caries. Longitudinal cohort studies are recommended to determine causal mechanisms.},
